## About

The DVR Video Player Simulator replicates the functionalities of a traditional DVR system video player, providing an interactive and dynamic video playback experience. It allows users to load multiple video files and display them in a grid layout that can be adjusted between 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 formats. The system offers core DVR functionalities such as:

- **Play:** Start playing videos in the selected grid format.
- **Pause:** Temporarily pause video playback.
- **Stop:** Stop the videos and reset to the first frame.
- **Keep Aspect Ratio:** Toggle aspect ratio preservation for each video feed.
- **Timeline Slider:** Navigate through the video by sliding along the timeline.
- **Context Menu:** Easily switch between different grid layouts via a right-click context menu.

The simulator is designed to provide a responsive layout with controls like play, pause, stop, and a timeline slider. It supports multiple video formats (MP4, AVI, and more).
